I'm Mark Xu. I want to be omnibenevolent. To this end, I am also interested in becoming omniscient and omnipotent. I approximate this by employing to their fullest extent the technological prostheses that humanity has developed, attempting to craft my own if nothing existent suffices.

If you think a conversation with me will increase the world's expected utility, feel free to book a time [here](https://calendly.com/markxu/30min).
