I'm Mark Xu. I want to omnibenevolent. To this end, I am also interested in becoming omniscient and omnipotent. I approximate this by employing the technological prostheses that the human engine has generated on its meandering quest for self-improvement, attempting to craft my own if nothing existent suffices.

If you think a conversation with me will increase the world's expected utility, feel free to book a time [here](https://calendly.com/markxu/30min)
