I'm Mark Xu. I look like this:

I strive to act in a way that is maximally good. I currently approximate this by working to ensure the existence and flourishing of future sentient beings. I believe humanity's current best efforts to do the same are the [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/) and [rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/xhQxJ7WSZZRkzNZJ8) communities.

Leave me anonymous feedback [here](https://www.admonymous.co/mark). If you think a conversation with me will be beneficial, feel free to book a time [here](https://calendly.com/markxu). My resume is located [here](/downloads/resume.pdf).
