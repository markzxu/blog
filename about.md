title: About

I'm Mark Xu. I want to be omnibenevolent. To this end, I am also interested in becoming omniscient and omnipotent. I approximate this by employing to their fullest extent the technological prostheses that humanity has developed, attempting to craft my own if nothing existent suffices.

Content is my own beliefs at the time of writing, lossily compressed into langauge. I will attempt to include the necessary nuance and caveats, although I can make no guarantees.

If you think a conversation with me will be beneficial, feel free to book a time [here](https://calendly.com/markxu/30min).
