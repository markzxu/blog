I'm Mark Xu. I want to be omnibenevolent. To this end, I am also interested in becoming omniscient and omnipotent. I approximate this by employing the cognitive and technological prostheses that humanity has developed.

Content is my own beliefs at the time of writing, lossily encrypted into language. I will attempt to include the necessary nuance and caveats, although I can make no guarantees.
