I'm Mark Xu. I want to be omnibenevolent. To this end, I am also interested in becoming omniscient and omnipotent. I currently approximate this by working to ensure the existence and flourishing of future sentient beings. I believe humanity's current best efforts to do the same are the [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/) and [rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/xhQxJ7WSZZRkzNZJ8) communities.

Content is my own beliefs at the time of writing, lossily compressed into language.
