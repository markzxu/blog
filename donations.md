One of the ways to do good is to give money to effective charities. Since I'm advocating this, below is a public record of my donations. "Summary" shows the aggregate of donations that I optimized for direct altruistic impact. "Details" includes other donations.

"Income" shows my "adjusted gross income" as reported on various US tax forms. 

## Summary

| ---- | ------ | --------- | ---------- |
| 2020 | 81763  | 2560      | 3.1        |
| 2019 | 39738  | 2999      | 7.5        |
| 2018 | 8402   | 1000      | 11.9       |
