I strive to [take beliefs seriously](https://radimentary.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/singularity-mindset/). One way of doing this is betting on your beliefs. For that reason, I have taken the [bettor's oath](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2012/05/the_bettors_oat.html). Below is a record of public bets I've made.

* On the 4th of September 2020, I bet \$800 of my money against \$1200 of Noa Nabeshima's money that the following will not happen: Systems in GPT line will  make less than one billion dollars in customer revenue clearly tied to such systems by 2025, counting the best percentage estimates of product revenue for systems that contain GPT line subcomponents. Resolution will be adjudicated by [this metaculus question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5118/will-robin-hanson-win-a-bet-that-the-gpt-line-of-language-models-will-generate--1bn-in-customer-revenue-by-2025/). Winner: unknown. 
* On the 8th of September 2020, I bet \$20 of my money against \$17 of Jack Ryan's money that the following will not happen: Donald Trump will be reelected president in 2020. Winner: unknown. 
* On the 18th of October 2020, I bet \$1 of my money againts \$1.5 of Sidney Hough's money that the following will not happen: the number of daily new covornavircuses cases in France will rise above 40,000 in the month of October. Resolution will be adjudicated by [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/france/). Winner: unknown.
