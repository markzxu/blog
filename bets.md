I strive to [take beliefs seriously](https://radimentary.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/singularity-mindset/). One way of doing this is betting on your beliefs. For that reason, I have taken the [bettor's oath](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2012/05/the_bettors_oat.html). Below is a record of public bets I've made.
