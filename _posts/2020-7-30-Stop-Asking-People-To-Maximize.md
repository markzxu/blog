title: Stop Asking People To Maximize
published: true

When getting to know people, people sometimes ask "what's your favorite \<category\>?" (where \<category\> can be books, movies, tv shows, colors, foods, etc.) This question is not [computationally kind](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computational-kindness) - it asks people to _maximize_ over all items in \<category\> and pick the one that they like best. It forces people to compare many things against each other along many dimensions.

A better question to ask people is "what are some instances of \<category\> that you like?" Asking people to [statisfice](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Satisficing) is much kinder than asking them to maximize. In practice, the answers to this question are likely indistinguishable from the answers to the previous question. 

In general, there are a lot of standard conversational patterns that have large computational costs hidden in words like "best" or "favorite". I encourage you to replace these patterns with ones that don't require maximization.

Examples:

What's your favorite color? -\> What's a color you enjoy?

What's your best childhood memory? -\> What's a fond memory from your childhood?

What's your favorite movie? -\> What's a movie you're always happy to watch?

What's your favorite food? -\> What's your goto order at a restaurant you frequent? 

What's your favorite TV show? -\> What's a show that you've binged recently?
