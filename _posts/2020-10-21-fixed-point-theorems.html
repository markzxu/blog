<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>A fixed point of a function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is a point such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x\)</span>. Fixed point theorems are theorems that that show that various types of functions have fixed points. Sometimes, they even give you a method for finding those fixed points.</p>
<p>Fixed point theorems can roughly be divided into 3 categories: Topological, Diagonal, and Iterative.</p>
<p>Topological fixed points are non-constructive. If <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R\)</span> is continuous a function such that <span class="math inline">\(f(0) &lt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(1) &gt; 1\)</span>, then it must be that <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> crosses <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> at some point, so it must have a fixed point. However, there is no principled way to select the fixed point (especially since it’s possible that there are an uncountable number of fixed points). The Brouwer fixed point theorem shows the existence of topological fixed points (under certain conditions).</p>
<p>Diagonal fixed points are constructed by feeding a function into itself (sometimes called quining). This technique is very strong and proves, among other things, Gödel’s Incompleteness, the Halting Problem, etc. Roger’s fixed point theorem shows the existence of diagonal fixed points.</p>
<p>Iterative fixed points can be found by repeatedly iterating a function on any point. The function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = -\frac{x}{2}\)</span> has a fixed point given by <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{n \to \infty} f^n(x)\)</span> for any point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The Banach fixed point theorem shows the existence of iterative fixed points under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Why are fixed points interesting? They can be used in a bunch of ways to prove interesting things. Godel’s incompletness theorems are about fixed points of sentences. The existence of mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium is a consequence of Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem. The existence and uniqueness of ODE’s can be shown with Banach Fixed Point Theorem. Roger Fixed Point theorem shows the existence of computer programs that can “talk about themselves" in some sense</p>
<h1 id="iterative-fixed-points">Iterative Fixed Points</h1>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\((X, d)\)</span> be a complete metric space. Metric space means you can measure stuff in a way that satisfies the triangle inequality. Complete means that it contains all it’s limit points. <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R^n\)</span> is the example you should have in mind. A map <span class="math inline">\(T: X \to X\)</span> is a <em>contraction mapping</em> if there exists <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq q &lt; 1\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[d(T(x), T(y)) \leq qd(x, y)\]</span> That is, the map <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> must shrink distances between points when you apply it. Notice that contraction mappings must be continuous because discontinuities violate the contraction property.</p>
<p>For any (continuous) contraction mapping <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> on a non-empty complete metric space, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has a unique fixed point equal to <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{n \to \infty} T^n(x)\)</span> for arbitrarily chosen <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be our space and pick <span class="math inline">\(x_0 \in X\)</span> arbitrarily. Define a sequence <span class="math inline">\(\{x_n\}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x_n = T^n(x_0)\)</span>. Inductively, we have that <span class="math display">\[d(x_{n+ 1}, x_n) \leq q^n d(x_1, x_0)\]</span> Furthermore, the sequence <span class="math inline">\(\{x_n\}\)</span> is Cauchy. Let <span class="math inline">\(m, n\)</span> be such that <span class="math inline">\(m &gt; n\)</span>. Notice that since <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> satisfies the triangle inequality: <span class="math display">\[d(x_m, x_n) \leq d(x_m, x_{m - 1}) + d(x_{m - 1}, x_{m - 2}) + ... + d(x_{n + 1}, x_n)\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a contraction mapping: <span class="math display">\[\leq q^{m -1 }d(x_1, x_0) + q^{m - 2}d(x_1, x_0) + ... + q^nd(x_1, x_0)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\leq q^n d(x_1, x_0) \sum_{k = 0}^\infty q^k\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\leq q^n d(x_1, x_0) \left( \frac{1}{1 - q} \right)\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq q &lt; 1\)</span>, picking sufficiently large <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> will guarantee that <span class="math inline">\(x_m, x_n\)</span> are within <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon &gt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>By completeness, <span class="math inline">\(x_n \to x\)</span> has a limit in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. By continuity of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, we can interchange limits, giving <span class="math inline">\(x = \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} T(x_{n - 1}) = T(\lim_{n \to \infty} T_{n - 1}) = T(x)\)</span></p>
<p>Uniqueness is a simple consequence of the face that <span class="math inline">\(d(x, y) \neq d(T(x), T(y))\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="diagonal-fixed-points">Diagonal Fixed Points</h1>
<p>Diagonal fixed points are the fixed points of logic and computers. First we have to define the domain of the functions that have fixed points. In this case, it’s the set of all partial recursive functions from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb N \to \mathbb N\)</span>. Partial means that it might not be defined on some input (contrast to total, which means defined on every input). Recursive means that you can build it out of a small set of elementary functions along with some rules of construction. An easy way to think about partial recursive functions is that they are just computer programs. This isn’t just a good abstraction; we can prove that a function is partial recursive if and only if you can write down a computer program that computes it.</p>
<p>How do we do this? On a high level, think of a computer program as just a set of transition rules between memory states of your computer, i.e. a bunch of statements of the sort "if we have a 1 in memory location 42 and a 0 in memory location 46, then at the next step, we must have a 1 in memory location 5". This means that we can define a mathematical function that takes a program and a memory state and returns the next memory state. Using this, we can define another function that asks if there is a sequence of memory states, each of which came from the one before it, such that the last state is the halting state with a particular output.</p>
<p>Now that we know what the domain is, how do we define a fixed point? First we fix some <em>admissible numbering</em> <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> of partial recursive functions (also sometimes called an <em>effective enumeration</em>. This is just some sequence <span class="math inline">\(\phi_n\)</span> that contains every partial recursive function and that you can write down a computer program that prints <span class="math inline">\(\phi_n\)</span> in order. Why do we know that this exists? Well computer programs can be thought of as strings from some finite alphabet (ASCII if you want). We can just write a compute program that prints out all possible strings. Most of these won’t be computer programs, but that’s fine because they’ll be the empty program, which is just the unique program that’s undefined on every input.</p>
<p>Given this, a fixed point of a function <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is an index <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\phi_e \simeq \phi_{F(e)}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\phi_n \simeq \phi_m\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\phi_n, \phi_m\)</span> agree whenever either of them is defined (they are, in some sense, the same computer program). This leads us to our fixed point theorem.</p>
<p>Every total computable function <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> has a fixed point.</p>
<p>First we’ll have to define a total function <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. Defining this is math is hard, so we will define it with programming</p>
<pre><code>def h(x):
    def f(y):
        e = \phi_x(x)
        return \phi_e(y)
    return f</code></pre>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is an admissible numbering, this is a real computer program. What does this program even do? Well if <span class="math inline">\(\phi_x(x)\)</span> is defined, then <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{h(x)}\)</span> is the program <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that we define in <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> fixed. Since <span class="math inline">\(\phi_x(x)\)</span> is defined, <span class="math inline">\(f(y)\)</span> will always return <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{\phi_x(x)}\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{h(x)} \simeq \phi_{\phi_x(x)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now let <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be any total computable function. Consider <span class="math inline">\(F \circ h\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is an admissible numbering, every partial recursive function appears somewhere. Namely, there exists some <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\phi_e \simeq F \circ h\)</span>. By the above, we have that <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{h(e)} \simeq \phi_{\phi_e(e)}\)</span>. However, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_e \simeq F \circ h\)</span>, so we have that <span class="math inline">\(\phi_e(e) = F(h(e))\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{\phi_e(e)} \simeq \phi_{F(h(e))}\)</span>. By transitivity, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{h(e)} \simeq \phi_{F(h(e))}\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(h(e)\)</span> is a fixed point of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="topological-fixed-points">Topological Fixed Points</h1>
<p>First we’ll prove a combinatorial version of this fixed point theorem.</p>
<p>Given an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional simplex and a triangulation <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> colored into <span class="math inline">\(n + 1\)</span> colors such that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <span class="math inline">\(n + 1\)</span> vertexes that are the “corners" of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> are colored differently.</p></li>
<li><p>The vertexes on any <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-dimensional surface of the large simplex are only colored the colors of the “corners" included in that subface.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> has an odd number of simplices that contain all colors. Crucially, there exists 1 such simplex.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Well, a 1-simplex is a line segment, so the claim is that if we put vertexes on a line and color the endpoints differently, the color must swap an odd number of times. Let’s start by proving the one dimensional case.</p>
<p>If we put only 2 vertexes on the line, then it’s obvious. Given that it’s true for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertexes, let’s add one more vertex. If you add it between switching colors, then you must maintain the number of switches. If you add it between non-switching colors, you can either add 2 switches or maintain the same number. Odd numbers plus 2 are still odd, so that completes the proof.</p>
<p>A 2-simplex is a triangle. Sperner’s Lemma says that if you color a triangle made of smaller triangles into three colors with the corners being different colors and the edges between the corners only containing those two colors, then there exist an odd number of sub-triangles that have all 3 colors. Let’s prove this (actually we’re just going to prove it for all dimensions now, but whatever).</p>
<p>In general, think of a <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-simplex as the set of points unit taxicab distance from the origin, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^n = \{P \in \mathbb R^{n + 1} | \sum P_i = 1\}\)</span></p>
<p>Suppose that we have Sperner’s Lemma for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> dimensions. Construct a graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> in the following way. Let <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> be the set of all the “spaces" in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> plus one vertex that represents the outside (call this <span class="math inline">\(o\)</span>). Pick a random color <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and let two vertexes have an edge between then if they share a <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> simplex face with every color present except for <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Add edges between vertexes and <span class="math inline">\(o\)</span> if they "share" a face with the outside. Note that by definition of the coloring of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, only one face that is adjacent with the outside contains all but the color <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Apply Sperner’s Lemma to this face to show that it must contain and odd number of <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> simplices with all colors but <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, which shows that <span class="math inline">\(o\)</span> has odd degree.</p>
<p>Now observe that the vertexes that aren’t <span class="math inline">\(o\)</span> must have degree 0, 1, or 2. Why is this the case? Suppose that the degree is at least 1. That means that we know the colors of all but 1 vertex. Suppose that this vertex is colored <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Then any face that contains this vertex will not produce an edge, so the degree is 1. Suppose that this vertex is not colored <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Then it will be the same as some other vertex, so we can include a face that swaps out those two vertexes. However, every other face will contain both of these vertexes, so it cannot produce an edge. Thus the degree is 2. This also shows that a simplex contains every color if and only if the degree is 1.</p>
<p>By elementary graph theory, the sum of all degrees of all vertexes in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> must be even. Since <span class="math inline">\(o\)</span> has odd degree, there thus must be an odd number of vertexes with degree 1, completing the induction.</p>
<p>Now we can prove Brouwer:</p>
<p>Every continuous function from a convex set to itself has a fixed point.</p>
<p>First we consider the case of a continuous function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> from an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> dimensional simplex <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^n\)</span> to itself. By definition, we have that <span class="math display">\[\Delta^n = \{P \in \mathbb R^{n + 1} | \sum P_i = 1\}\]</span> For every point in <span class="math inline">\(P \in \Delta^n\)</span>, we can note that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{f(P)_i} = 1\)</span> also. By the Pigeon Hole principle, we for every point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, there exists an <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(P)_k \leq P_k\)</span>. In particular, such a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> can be selected such that <span class="math inline">\(P_k \neq 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Define the map <span class="math inline">\(color: \Delta^n \to \{1, ..., n + 1\}\)</span> such that each <span class="math inline">\(P \in \Delta^n\)</span> maps to a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> that satisfies the above (we use axiom of choice to do this). Let <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be any triangulation of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^n\)</span> colored according to <span class="math inline">\(color\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that since we have that <span class="math inline">\(P_{color(P)} \neq 0\)</span>, any "corner" will be colored exactly the index that it is non-zero. Furthermore, any point on some sub-simplex of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^n\)</span> will only contain colors of the endpoints. Thus <span class="math inline">\(color\)</span> is a Sperner Coloring of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, allowing us to apply Sperner’s Lemma, which guarantees the existence of a <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional simplex with all <span class="math inline">\(n + 1\)</span> colors.</p>
<p>By making <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> arbitrarily fine, we can select a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional simplicies that are all-chromatic and whose diameter goes to 0. Construct a sequence <span class="math inline">\(\{p_i\}\)</span> by picking 1 point from each simplex. Since <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^n\)</span> is compact, we can pick some convergent subsequence that converges to <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Suppose that there exists some index <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(P)_j &gt; P_j\)</span>. By continuity, any sufficiently small <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-simplex around <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> will not have all <span class="math inline">\(n + 1\)</span> colors, a contradiction. Thus we have that for every <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(P)_j \leq P_j\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\sum f(P)_i = \sum P_i = 1\)</span>, this must be equality. Thus <span class="math inline">\(f(P) = P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is a fixed point.</p>
<p>To generalize to arbitrary convex sets, we simply use the fact that convex projection, the fact that taking a set and mapping to the closest point of some convex set, is well-defined and continuous. Given any convex set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and a function <span class="math inline">\(g: S \to S\)</span>, construct a large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-simplex around it and compose <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> with the convex projection map. Any fixed point must lie in the range of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and thus must lie in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, implying it is a fixed point of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>.</p>
