title: If you weren't such a idiot...
---

My friend Buck once told me that he often had interactions with me that felt like I was saying "If you weren't such a fucking idiot, you would obviously do..." Here's a list of such advice in that spirit. 

Note that if you do/don't do these things, I'm *technically* calling you an idiot, but I do/don't do a bunch of them too. We can be idiots together.

If you weren't such a fucking idiot...

* You would have multiple copies of any object that would make you sad if you didn't have it
  * Examples: ear plugs, melatonin, eye masks, hats, sun glasses, various foods, possibly computers, etc.
* You would spend money on goods and services.
  * Examples of goods: faster computer, monitor, keyboard, various tasty foods, higher quality clothing, standing desk, decorations for your room, mattress, pillow, sheets, etc.
  * Examples of services: uber, doordash, cleaners, personal assistants, editors, house managers, laundry, etc.
* You would have tried many things at least one time.
  * Examples of things to do: climbing, singing, listening to music, playing instruments, dancing, eating various types of food, writing, parties.
* You wouldn't do anything absurdly dangerous, like take unknown drugs or ride a bike without a helmet.
* You wouldn't take irreversible actions if you didn't know what the fuck you were doing.
* You would exercise frequently.
  * Types of exercise to try: climbing, walking, running, soccer, football, yoga, hiking, fencing, swimming, wrestling, beat saber, etc.
* You would reliably sleep 6-9 hours a night.
  * Obvious things to try:
    * melatonin
    * blackout curtains
    * putting black tape over LEDs on electronics
    * experimenting with mattress, pillow, blankets, sheets, etc.
    * blue light blocking glasses
* You would routinely look up key numbers and do numerical consistency checks during thinking.
* You would have a password manager.
* You would invest money in yourself.
  * Recall: money can be used to buy goods and services.
* You would use a email's subject line to succinctly describe what you want from the person.
  * For example, if I want to meet with my advisor, I'll send an email with the subject "Request for Advisory Meeting" or something similar. If I want someone to read a draft of something I wrote, the subject would be "Request for Feedback on \<Title\>".
* You would have a good mentor.
  * One way to do this is to email people that you want to be your mentor with the subject "Request for Mentorship".
* You would drink lots of water.
* You would take notes in a searchable database.
* You would summarize things that you read.
* You would have tried making your room as bright as the outdoors.
* You would carry batteries to recharge your phone.
* You would have tried using pens with multiple colors.
* You would read textbooks instead of popular introductions.
* You would put a relatively consistent dollar value on your time.

I'm sure there are more things that I tell people that can be prefaced with "if you weren't such an idiot...", but that's all I got for now.
