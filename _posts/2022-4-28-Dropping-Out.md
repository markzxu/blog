title: "'Dropping out' isn't an Plan"

The follow career-choice diagram looks silly:

"Go into finance" is a career plan; "Don't go into finance" is the absence of a plan. Clearly, it makes more sense for the diagram to look like:

Similarly, many people seem to implicitly use something like the following career-choice diagram when thinking about school:

However, "don't go to school" isn't a career plan. Advice I often give such people is to use a diagram that doesn't centralize "school or not school":
