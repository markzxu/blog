The following career-choice diagram looks silly:

"Go into finance" is a career plan; "Don't go into finance" is the absence of a plan, so it shouldn't be a choice-node. It makes more sense for the diagram to look like:

Similarly, many people seem to implicitly use something like the following career-choice diagram when thinking about school:

However, "don't go to school" isn't a career plan, so it shouldn't be a choice node. The diagram should look more like:
