Recently, I've been about as productive as I've ever been. One reason for this is my current routine, which can roughly be described as "systematize literally everything". I currently work from home. Here's a snapshot of what my routine currently looks like. 

* Monday-Saturday
  * ~0800: wake up
  * 0800-0900: eat breakfast, respond to messages, anki, clean various mouth and face parts, and change
  * 0900-1000: work (count: 1)
    * all work is general done in pomodoros of 25 minutes work followed by 5 minutes break
    * I find coworking helpful for productivity mostly because it makes breaks more enjoyable
  * 1000-1030: stand-up
    * This is a thing where I get together with some of my friends and we write down the goals we have for the day. It's been pretty useful for accountability.
  * 1030-1400: work (count: 4.5)
  * 1400-1500: lunch
    * I generally read while I eat, although I'm not sure if this is a good thing
  * 1500-1600: take a walk, a nap, or both
    * I often listen to podcasts on walks, although sometimes I think
  * 1600-1800: work (count: 6.5)
  * 1800-1900: exercise
  * 1900-1930: dinner
  * 1930-2000: shower
    * I often choose what to think about in the shower, but sometimes I try to shower quickly because I don't start showering until 1950
  * 2000-2200: work (count: 8.5)
    * I usually have calls during some of the work hours so I don't actually do 8.5 hours of work a day for 6 days a week
    * I think it might be [psychologically impossible](http://mindingourway.com/where-coulds-go/) for many people, potentially me included, to do more than ~5 hours of focused work a day
      * fortunately (unfortunately?) there are many tasks that need doing that do not require focus, e.g. responding to emails, making Facebook events, doing laundry, etc. 
  * 2200-2230: clean mouth parts, meditate
  * 2230: sleep
* Sunday
  * weekly review
    * questions I ask myself
      * what did I want to spend time on last week?
      * what did I spend time on last week?
      * what do I want to spend my time on next week?
      * how can I make it more likely that I spend time on the things I want to spend time on?
    * examples of answers to the 4th bullet:
      * block my phone during exercise time
      * created 10am stand-up
      * planning my exercise routine
      * adding a non-work hour after lunch
  * life maintenance
    * laundry
    * basic cleaning
    * miscellaneous accumulated tasks like short reports that need written, emails that need responding to, Amazon purchases that need returning, etc. 
  * rest of the time is whatever I want
    * generally I still go to stand-up and eat lunch around 1400
    * I often do some amount of work, but it's less focused/directed than normal
    * I try to have fun calls with friends on Sundays
  * I sleep at the same time on Sunday as all other days
    * sleep consistency is very important
* Other bits
  * Exercise routine
    * Monday, Friday:
      * 4 set of 12 reps of
        * squats
        * bench press
        * dumbbell rows
        * deadlifts
    * Wednesday:
      * 4 sets of 12 reps of
        * squats
        * overhead press
        * chin-ups
        * Romanian deaflifts
    * Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday:
      * generic cardio 
        * my knee hurts occasionally, so right now this is mostly Beat Saber
      * core
        * 3 sets of 3 reps of 30 seconds of:
          * planks
          * russian twists
          * crunches
    * Every day ends with a ~8 minute stretch routine
  * Helpful software
    * [Todoist](https://todoist.com/app/)
      * I put many more things into Todoist than many people think is reasonable, including all parts of my exercise routine, showering, checking my email, doing anki, meditating, etc. 
        * Basically everything I do consistently that doesn't happen at a precise time is a recurring task
          * also most of the time everything I potentially want to do in the future is in my Todoist backlog
            * notable exceptions include readings, which are in [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/u)
        * I also put 8 25-minute pomodoros to make sure that I'm doing at least 4 hours of focused work
        * Often times "work" in my calendar involves calls or events
    * [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r)
      * I schedule more things than many people think is reasonable, i.e. literally everything.
      * I find it very helpful to not have to wonder what I should be doing at any given moment because I can instead just check my calendar
    * [Freedom](https://freedom.to/dashboard)
      * Distracting websites are blocked outside of 0830-0845 (except for Sundays)
      * All websites are blocked during 1800-1900 (exercise time)
    * [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/dashboard)
      * Helps me track computer usage to see if I'm complying to my routines
    * All my electronic devices don't work after 10pm, except for the specialized ones
      * this is accomplished through various cron jobs, Apple screen time, freedom, and [Lock Me Out](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teqtic.lockmeout&hl=en_US&gl=US)
      * specialized devices include
        * [Freewrite Traveler](https://getfreewrite.com/products/freewrite-traveler)
        * [Remarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2)
        * [iPod Touch](https://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/)
          * has very limited functionality after 10pm. Roughly only Todoist and google calendar.
        * Kindle
    * [MultiTimer](https://multitimer.net/)
      * useful for exercising and stretching
  * Other tricks
    * I take 0.3 mg [Melatonin](https://www.gwern.net/Melatonin) at ~1900 every day
    * I change into pajamas after I shower
      * I'm not sure this does anything, but it sure feels like it might
    * I don't use an alarm in the morning
      * the logic is that if I oversleep, that means I needed it
    * All my clothing is approximately the same, so I don't really make decisions on that front
    * If I notice that I don't really want to do any particular bit of work, then I switch to doing something else
      * This blog post is being written because I felt tired when I tried to revise a research write-up
    * I have a pair of [noise canceling headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM2/dp/B074KDJVS2) that I try to wear if and only if I'm working
    * I place large importance on respecting the work/break cycle of the pomodoros, e.g. when it's time for a break, I take a break at that instant even if I feel tempted to work for just one more minute
      * similarly, even if I'm talking about something interesting with a friend during a break, I cut off the conversation when the break is over
      * I think this is pretty important for avoiding the trap of co-working becoming co-not-working
    * my room is [very bright](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hC2NFsuf5anuGadFm/how-to-build-a-lumenator) during the day, but my lights are orange at night
    * I wear earplugs to sleep
