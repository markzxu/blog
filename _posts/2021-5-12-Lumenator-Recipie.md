> Let there be light.

My current lumenator consists of three copies of the following:

* 2x [LED Pure White CRI 95 Corn Bulb](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PS4P15M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* 1x [LED Warm White CRI 95 Corn Bulb](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PNVTPCR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1)
* 1x [Adesso Floor Lamp](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PRNWBC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

My previous lumenator consisted of:

* 3x [16 bulb light string](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HLTF5L1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* 32x [5000k CRI 90 LED](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JMP9K7W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* 16x [2700k CRI 90 LED](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WW36YDK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

My previous lumenator was both much brigher and much uglier than my current one. It also took much longer to setup. For those that care less about aesthetics, a single lamp with a [240W corn bulb](https://www.amazon.com/DragonLight-Commercial-Fanless-1000Watt-Replacement/dp/B08DY1GCC6) will generate a lot of lumens.
