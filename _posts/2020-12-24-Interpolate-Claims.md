title: Interpolate Claims (Un)charitably

The [principle of charity](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Principle_of_charity) requires interpreting the speaker's claims in the strongest possible light. However, this process has ambiguity. If I say "money can't buy happiness," the truest version interpretation is "the is no way to convert money directly into happiness"; however, this isn't likely to be what I meant. The principle of charity is also context-dependent; the "strongest possible light" is always relative to background beliefs. Two listeners might hear the same claim, apply the principle of charity, and have different interpretations. For example, one person who hears "money can't buy happiness" might take it to mean "money has diminishing marginal returns on happiness." In contrast, the other might take it to mean "people above a certain income threshold do not become happier when given additional money." Both people might agree with their charitable interpretation of what I said, but one of them disagrees with what I meant.

A better way to interpret a claim is to take all possible ways it could be construed and indicate how much you agree with each interpretation. For instance, if someone claims "apples are heavy," I would ideally provide my subjective probability distribution over apples' weight. In general, I would model the situation with free parameters, then give a distribution over those parameters. This process is intractable.

A tractable approximation is picking the "most true" and "most false" interpretations and interpolating between them; we might call these the weak and strong versions of the claim. This process amounts to modeling the claim with one free variable and giving a rough distribution. For example, suppose I claim, "humanity is bad at coordination." When I get called out for not being specific enough, I might say, "The weak version of the claim is that there exists at least one societal Pareto improvement that hasn't been implemented. The strong version might be that such Pareto improvements are plentiful and easy to spot. I think the weak version is obviously true, and the strong version is mostly true."

Finding weak and strong versions of other people's claims lets you find the point where you go from agreement to disagreement, allowing you to better identify your own beliefs and pinpoint disagreements more precisely.
